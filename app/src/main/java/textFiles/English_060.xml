<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><sura id="60">  <aya id="1" text="O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists, etc.) as friends, showing affection towards them, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism, this Qur'ân, and Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allâh your Lord! If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My Good Pleasure, (then take not these disbelievers and polytheists, etc., as your friends). You show friendship to them in secret, while I am All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray, (away) from the Straight Path ." />  <aya id="2" text="Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you should disbelieve." />  <aya id="3" text="Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection (against Allâh). He will judge between you. And Allâh is the All-Seer of what you do." />  <aya id="4" text="Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhim (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &amp;quot;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allâh Alone,&amp;quot; except the saying of Ibrâhim (Abraham) to his father: &amp;quot;Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allâh) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allâh .&amp;quot; Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return," />  <aya id="5" text="&amp;quot;Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the disbelievers, and forgive us, Our Lord! Verily, You, only You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="6" text="Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allâh (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allâh is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise." />  <aya id="7" text="Perhaps Allâh will make friendship between you and those whom you hold as enemies. And Allâh has power (over all things), and Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." />  <aya id="8" text="Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity." />  <aya id="9" text="It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allâh forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn &lt;/I&gt;(wrong-doers  those who disobey Allâh)." />  <aya id="10" text="O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them, Allâh knows best as to their Faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers, send them not back to the disbelievers, they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them. But give the disbelievers that (amount of money) which they have spent [as their &lt;I&gt;Mahr&lt;/I&gt; ] to them. And there will be no sin on you to marry them if you have paid their &lt;I&gt;Mahr&lt;/I&gt; to them. Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives, and ask for (the return of) that which you have spent (as &lt;I&gt;Mahr&lt;/I&gt;) and let them (the disbelievers, etc.) ask back for that which they have spent. That is the Judgement of Allâh. He judges between you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise." />  <aya id="11" text="And if any of your wives have gone from you to the disbelievers, and you have an accession (by the coming over of a woman from the other side), then pay to those whose wives have gone, the equivalent of what they had spent (on their &lt;I&gt;Mahr&lt;/I&gt;). And fear Allâh in Whom you believe." />  <aya id="12" text="O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the &lt;I&gt;Bai'â&lt;/I&gt; (pledge), that they will not associate anything in worship with Allâh, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (i.e. by making illegal children belonging to their husbands), and that they will not disobey you in any &lt;I&gt;Ma'rûf&lt;/I&gt; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that which Islâm ordains) then accept their &lt;I&gt;Bai'â&lt;/I&gt; (pledge), and ask Allâh to forgive them, Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." />  <aya id="13" text="O you who believe! Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allâh (i.e. the Jews). Surely, they have been in despair to receive any good in the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have been in despair about those (buried) in graves (that they will not be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection)." /></sura>
