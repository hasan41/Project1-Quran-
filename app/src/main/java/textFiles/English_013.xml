Then, He &lt;I&gt;Istawâ &lt;/I&gt;(rose above) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round)! Each running (its course) for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord." />  <aya id="3" text="And it is He Who spread out the earth, and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and of every kind of fruits He made &lt;I&gt;Zawjain Ithnaîn &lt;/I&gt;(two in pairs - may mean two kinds or it may mean: of two sorts, e.g. black and white, sweet and sour, small and big, etc.) He brings the night as a cover over the day. Verily, in these things, there are &lt;I&gt;Ayât&lt;/I&gt; (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.) for people who reflect." />  <aya id="4" text="And in the earth are neighbouring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields etc.), and date-palms, growing out two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise (one stem root for every palm ), watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Verily, in these things, there are &lt;I&gt;Ayât&lt;/I&gt; (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs) for the people who understand." />  <aya id="5" text="And if you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) wonder (at these polytheists who deny your message of Islâmic Monotheism and have taken besides Allâh others for worship who can neither harm nor benefit), then wondrous is their saying: &amp;quot;When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation?&amp;quot; They are those who disbelieve in their Lord! They are those who will have iron chains tying their hands to their necks. They will be dwellers of the Fire to abide therein." />  <aya id="6" text="They ask you to hasten the evil before the good, yet (many) exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But verily, your Lord is full of Forgiveness for mankind inspite of their wrong-doing. And verily, your Lord is (also) Severe in punishment." />  <aya id="7" text="And the disbelievers say: &amp;quot;Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?&amp;quot; You are only a warner, and to every people there is a guide." />  <aya id="8" text="Allâh knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed.

They guard him by the Command of Allâh. Verily! Allâh will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh). But when Allâh wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector." />  <aya id="12" text="It is He who shows you the lightning, as a fear (for travellers) and as a hope (for those who wait for rain). And it is He Who brings up (or originates) the clouds, heavy (with water)." />  <aya id="13" text="And &lt;I&gt;Ar-Ra'd&lt;/I&gt; (thunder) glorifies and praises Him, and so do the angels because of His Awe, He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills, yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allâh. And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment." />  <aya id="14" text="For Him (Alone) is the Word of Truth (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He). And those whom they (polytheists and disbelievers) invoke, answer them no more than one who stretches forth his hand (at the edge of a deep well) for water to reach his mouth, but it reaches him not, and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but an error (i.e. of no use)." />  <aya id="15" text="And unto Allâh (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons." />  <aya id="16" text="Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;): &amp;quot;Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?&amp;quot; Say: &amp;quot;(It is) Allâh.&amp;quot; Say: &amp;quot;Have you then taken (for worship) &lt;I&gt;Auliyâ' &lt;/I&gt;(protectors, etc.) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?&amp;quot; Say: &amp;quot;Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allâh partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.&amp;quot; Say: &amp;quot;Allâh is the Creator of all things, He is the One, the Irresistible.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="17" text="He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure, but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface, and (also) from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, rises a foam like unto it, thus does Allâh (by parables) show forth truth and falsehood . Then, as for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allâh sets forth parables (for the truth and falsehood, i.e. Belief and disbelief)." />  <aya id="18" text="For those who answered their Lord's Call [believed in the Oneness of Allâh and followed His Messenger Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; i.e. Islâmic Monotheism] is &lt;I&gt;Al-Husna&lt;/I&gt; (i.e. Paradise). But those who answered not His Call (disbelieved in the Oneness of Allâh and followed not His Messenger Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), if they had all that is in the earth together with its like, they would offer it in order to save themselves (from the torment, it will be in vain). For them there will be the terrible reckoning. Their dwelling place will be Hell; - and worst indeed is that place for rest." />  <aya id="19" text="Shall he then who knows that what has been revealed unto you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) from your Lord is the truth be like him who is blind?

And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieve because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) settle close to their homes, until the Promise of Allâh comes to pass. Certainly, Allâh does not fail in His Promise." />  <aya id="32" text="And indeed (many) Messengers were mocked at before you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), but I granted respite to those who disbelieved, and finally I punished them. Then how (terrible) was My Punishment!" />  <aya id="33" text="Is then He (Allâh) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides, etc.) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)? Yet they ascribe partners to Allâh. Say: &amp;quot;Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words.&amp;quot; Nay! To those who disbelieve, their plotting is made fairseeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Path, and whom Allâh sends astray, for him, there is no guide." />  <aya id="34" text="For them is a torment in the life of this world, and certainly, harder is the torment of the Hereafter.

Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;): &amp;quot;I am commanded only to worship Allâh (Alone) and not to join partners with Him.
