Verily, there has come to you the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) with the truth from your Lord, so believe in him, it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, then certainly to Allâh belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allâh is Ever All&amp;#173;Knowing, All&amp;#173;Wise." />  <aya id="171" text="O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allâh aught but the truth. The Messiah 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allâh and His Word, (&amp;quot;Be!&amp;quot; - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (&lt;I&gt;Rûh&lt;/I&gt;) created by Him; so believe in Allâh and His Messengers. Say not: &amp;quot;Three (trinity)!&amp;quot; Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allâh is (the only) One &lt;I&gt;Ilâh&lt;/I&gt; (God), Glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allâh is All&amp;#173;Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs." />  <aya id="172" text="The Messiah will never be proud to reject to be a slave to Allâh, nor the angels who are near (to Allâh). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself." />  <aya id="173" text="So, as for those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and did deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards, and more out of His Bounty. But as for those who refuse His worship and were proud, He will punish them with a painful torment . And they will not find for themselves besides Allâh any protector or helper." />  <aya id="174" text="O mankind! Verily, there has come to you a convincing proof (Prophet Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) from your Lord, and We sent down to you a manifest light (this Qur'ân)." />  <aya id="175" text="So, as for those who believed in Allâh and held fast to Him, He will admit them to His Mercy and Grace (i.e. Paradise), and guide them to Himself by a Straight Path." />  <aya id="176" text=". They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: &amp;quot;Allâh directs (thus) about &lt;I&gt;Al&amp;#173;Kalâlah &lt;/I&gt;(those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs). If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female. (Thus) does Allâh makes clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.&amp;quot;" /></sura>
