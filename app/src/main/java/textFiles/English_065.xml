<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><sura id="65">  <aya id="1" text="O Prophet (&lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their &lt;I&gt;'Iddah &lt;/I&gt;(prescribed periods), and count (accurately) their &lt;I&gt;'Iddah &lt;/I&gt;(periods ). And fear Allâh your Lord (O Muslims), and turn them not out of their (husband's) homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allâh. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allâh, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not, it may be that Allâh will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce)." />  <aya id="2" text="Then when they are about to fulfil their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take for witness two just persons from among you (Muslims). And establish the witness for Allâh. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allâh and the Last Day. And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)." />  <aya id="3" text="And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allâh, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allâh will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allâh has set a measure for all things." />  <aya id="4" text="And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the '&lt;I&gt;Iddah&lt;/I&gt; (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their '&lt;I&gt;Iddah&lt;/I&gt; (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their '&lt;I&gt;Iddah&lt;/I&gt; (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him." />  <aya id="5" text="That is the Command of Allâh, which He has sent down to you, and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will remit his sins from him, and will enlarge his reward." />  <aya id="6" text="Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not treat them in such a harmful way that they be obliged to leave. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver. Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you accept the advice of the other in a just way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may give suck for him (the father of the child)." />  <aya id="7" text="Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allâh has given him. Allâh puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allâh will grant after hardship, ease." />  <aya id="8" text="And many a town (population) revolted against the Command of its Lord and His Messengers, and We called it to a severe account (i.e. torment in this worldly life), and shall punish it with a horrible torment (in Hell, in the Hereafter)." />  <aya id="9" text="So it tasted the evil result of its disbelief, and the consequence of its disbelief was loss (destruction in this life and an eternal punishment in the Hereafter)." />  <aya id="10" text="Allâh has prepared for them a severe torment. So fear Allâh and keep your duty to Him, O men of understanding who have believed! - Allâh has indeed sent down to you a Reminder (this Qur'ân)." />  <aya id="11" text="(And has also sent to you) a Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), who recites to you the Verses of Allâh (the Qur'ân) containing clear explanations, that He may take out, those who believe and do righteous good deeds from the darkness (of polytheism and disbelief) to the light (of Monotheism and true Faith). And whosoever believes in Allâh and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. Allâh has indeed granted for him an excellent provision." />  <aya id="12" text="It is Allâh Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge." /></sura>
