There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer." />  <aya id="12" text="To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, He enlarges provision for whom He wills, and straitens (it for whom He wills). Verily! He is the All-Knower of everything." />  <aya id="13" text="He (Allâh) has ordained for you the same religion (Islâm) which He ordained for Nûh (Noah), and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and that which We ordained for Ibrahîm (Abraham), Mûsa (Mosesý) and 'Iesa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what it orders you to do practically), and make no divisions in it (religion) (i.e. various sects in religion). Intolerable for the &lt;I&gt;Mushrikûn&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt;, is that to which you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) call them. Allâh chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself who turns to Him in repentance and in obedience." />  <aya id="14" text="And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, through selfish transgression between themselves. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have been settled between them. And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture [i.e. the Taurâh (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] after them (i.e. Jews and Christians) are in grave doubt concerning it (i.e. Allâh's true religion Islâm or the Qur'ân)." />  <aya id="15" text="So unto this (religion of Islâm, alone and this Qur'ân) then invite (people) (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and &lt;I&gt;Istaqim&lt;/I&gt; [(i.e. stand firm and straight on Islâmic Monotheism by performing all that is ordained by Allâh (good deeds, etc.), and by abstaining from all that is forbidden by Allâh (sins and evil deeds, etc.)], as you are commanded, and follow not their desires but say: &amp;quot;I believe in whatsoever Allâh has sent down of the Book [all the holy Books, this Qur'ân and the Books of the old from the Taurât (Torah), or the Injeel (Gospel) or the Pages of Ibrâhim (Abraham)] and I am commanded to do justice among you, Allâh is our Lord and your Lord. For us our deeds and for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allâh will assemble us (all), and to Him is the final return." />  <aya id="16" text="And those who dispute concerning Allâh (His Religion of Islâmic Monotheism, with which Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; has been sent), after it has been accepted (by the people), of no use is their dispute before their Lord, and on them is wrath, and for them will be a severe torment ." />  <aya id="17" text="It is Allâh Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'ân) in truth, and the Balance (i.e. to act justly). And what can make you know that perhaps the Hour is close at hand?" />  <aya id="18" text="Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it, and know that it is the very truth. Verily, those who dispute concerning the Hour are certainly in error far away." />  <aya id="19" text="Allâh is very Gracious and Kind to His slaves. He gives provisions to whom He wills. And He is the All-Strong, the All-Mighty." />  <aya id="20" text="Whosoever desires (with his deeds) the reward of the Hereafter, We give him increase in his reward, and whosoever desires the reward of this world (with his deeds), We give him thereof (what is written for him), and he has no portion in the Hereafter." />  <aya id="21" text="Or have they partners with Allâh (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allâh has not allowed. And had it not been for a decisive Word (gone forth already), the matter would have been judged between them. And verily, for the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists and wrong-doers), there is a painful torment." />  <aya id="22" text="You will see (on the Day of Resurrection), the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) fearful of that which they have earned, and it (Allâh's Torment) will surely befall them, while those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous deeds (will be) in the flowering meadows of the Gardens (Paradise), having what they wish from their Lord. That is the supreme Grace, (Paradise)." />  <aya id="23" text="That is (the Paradise) whereof Allâh gives glad tidings to His slaves who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds. Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;): &amp;quot;No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.&amp;quot; And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof. Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (the deeds of those who are obedient to Him)." />  <aya id="24" text="Or say they: &amp;quot;He has invented a lie against Allâh?&amp;quot; If Allâh willed, He could have sealed your heart (so that you forget all that you know of the Qur'an). And Allâh wipes out falsehood, and establishes the truth (Islâm) by His Word (this Qur'an). Verily, He knows well what (the secrets) are in the breasts (of mankind)." />  <aya id="25" text="And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do." />  <aya id="26" text="And He answers (the invocation of) those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh  Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and gives them increase of His Bounty. And as for the disbelievers, theirs will be a severe torment." />  <aya id="27" text="And if Allâh were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily! He is in respect of His slaves, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer (of things that benefit them)." />  <aya id="28" text="And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and spreads abroad His Mercy. And He is the &lt;I&gt;Walî&lt;/I&gt; (Helper, Supporter, Protector, etc.), Worthy of all Praise." />  <aya id="29" text="And among His &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.) is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever moving (living) creatures He has dispersed in them both. And He is All-Potent over their assembling (i.e. resurrecting them on the Day of Resurrection after their death, and dispersion of their bodies) whenever He will." />  <aya id="30" text="And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. (See the Qur'ân Verse 35:45)." />  <aya id="31" text="And you cannot escape from Allâh (i.e. His Punishment) in the earth, and besides Allâh you have neither any &lt;I&gt;Walî &lt;/I&gt;(guardian or a protector) nor any helper." />  <aya id="32" text="And among His Signs are the ships, in the sea, like mountains." />  <aya id="33" text="If He wills, He causes the wind to cease, then they would become motionless on the back (of the sea). Verily, in this are signs for everyone patient and grateful." />  <aya id="34" text="Or He may destroy them (by drowning) because of that which their (people) have earned. And He pardons much." />  <aya id="35" text="And those who dispute (polytheists, etc. with Our Messenger Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) as regards Our &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, signs, verses, etc. of Islâmic Monotheism) may know that there is no place of refuge for them (from Allâh's punishment)." />  <aya id="36" text="So whatever you have been given is but a passing enjoyment for this worldly life, but that which is with Allâh (Paradise) is better and more lasting for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh  Islâmic Monotheism) and put their trust in their Lord (concerning all of their affairs)." />  <aya id="37" text="And those who avoid the greater sins , and &lt;I&gt;Al-Fawâhish &lt;/I&gt;(illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), and when they are angry, they forgive" />  <aya id="38" text="And those who answer the Call of their Lord [i.e. to believe that He is the only One Lord (Allâh), and to worship none but Him Alone], and perform &lt;I&gt;As-Salât&lt;/I&gt; (&lt;I&gt;Iqâmat-as-Salât&lt;/I&gt;), and who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them;" />  <aya id="39" text="And those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, they take revenge." />  <aya id="40" text="The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof, but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allâh.

And you will see the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists, wrong-doers, oppressors, etc.) when they behold the torment, they will say: &amp;quot;Is there any way of return (to the world)?&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="45" text="And you will see them brought forward to it (Hell) made humble by disgrace , (and) looking with stealthy glance. And those who believe will say: &amp;quot;Verily, the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; [i.e. &lt;I&gt;Al-Kâfirûn &lt;/I&gt;(disbelievers in Allâh, in His Oneness and in His Messenger &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; , polytheists, wrong-doers, etc.)] will be in a lasting torment." />  <aya id="46" text="And they will have no &lt;I&gt;Auliyâ' &lt;/I&gt;(protectors) to help them other than Allâh. And he whom Allâh sends astray, for him there is no way." />  <aya id="47" text="Answer the Call of your Lord (i.e. accept the Islâmic Monotheism, O mankind, and jinns) before there comes from Allâh a Day which cannot be averted. You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying (of your crimes as they are all recorded in the Book of your deeds)." />  <aya id="48" text="But if they turn away (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; from the Islâmic Monotheism, which you have brought to them). We have not sent you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) as a &lt;I&gt;Hafîz&lt;/I&gt; (protector) over them (i.e. to take care of their deeds and to recompense them). Your duty is to convey (the Message). And verily, when We cause man to taste of Mercy from Us, he rejoices thereat, but when some ill befalls them because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth, then verily, man (becomes) ingrate!" />  <aya id="49" text="To Allâh belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills." />  <aya id="50" text="Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things." />  <aya id="51" text=". It is not given to any human being that Allâh should speak to him unless (it be) by Inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise ." />  <aya id="52" text="And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) &lt;I&gt;Ruhan&lt;/I&gt; (an Inspiration, and a Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Qur'ân) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allâh's religion of Islâmic Monotheism)." />  <aya id="53" text="The Path of Allâh, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.
