And woe unto the disbelievers from a severe torment." />  <aya id="3" text="Those who prefer the life of this world instead of the Hereafter, and hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh (i.e.Islâm) and seek crookedness therein - They are far astray." />  <aya id="4" text="And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them. Then Allâh misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." />  <aya id="5" text="And indeed We sent Mûsa (Moses) with Our &lt;I&gt;Ayât&lt;/I&gt; (signs, proofs, and evidences) (saying): &amp;quot;Bring out your people from darkness into light, and make them remember the annals of Allâh. Truly, therein are evidences, proofs and signs for every patient, thankful (person).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="6" text="And (remember) when Mûsa (Moses) said to his people: &amp;quot;Call to mind Allâh's Favour to you, when He delivered you from Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) people who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women alive, and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="7" text="And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: &amp;quot;If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allâh), I will give you more (of My Blessings), but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily! My Punishment is indeed severe.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="8" text="And Mûsa (Moses) said: &amp;quot;If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily! Allâh is Rich (Free of all wants), Owner of all Praise.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="9" text="Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of Nûh (Noah), and 'Ad, and Thamud? And those after them? None knows them but Allâh. To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths (biting them from anger) and said: &amp;quot;Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="10" text="Their Messengers said: &amp;quot;What! Can there be a doubt about Allâh, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you (to Monotheism and to be obedient to Allâh) that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed.&amp;quot; They said: &amp;quot;You are no more than human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority i.e. a clear proof of what you say).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="11" text="Their Messengers said to them: &amp;quot;We are no more than human beings like you, but Allâh bestows His Grace to whom He wills of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the Permission of Allâh. And in Allâh (Alone) let the believers put their trust." />  <aya id="12" text="&amp;quot;And why should we not put our trust in Allâh while He indeed has guided us our ways. And we shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us, and in Allâh (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="13" text="And those who disbelieved, said to their Messengers: &amp;quot;Surely, we shall drive you out of our land, or you shall return to our religion.&amp;quot; So their Lord inspired them: &amp;quot;Truly, We shall destroy the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doers.)." />  <aya id="14" text="&amp;quot;And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing before Me (on the Day of Resurrection or fears My Punishment) and also fears My Threat.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="15" text="But they (the Messengers) sought victory and help [from their Lord (Allâh)], and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allâh) was brought to a complete loss and destruction." />  <aya id="16" text="In front of him (every obstinate, arrogant dictator) is Hell, and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water." />  <aya id="17" text="He will sip it unwillingly, and he will find a great difficulty to swallow it down his throat , and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die and in front of him, will be a great torment." />  <aya id="18" text="The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day, they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned.

It makes no difference to us (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience, there is no place of refuge for us.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="22" text="And &lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt; (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: &amp;quot;Verily, Allâh promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, so you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allâh (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="23" text="And those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh and His Messengers and whatever they brought) and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow, - to dwell therein forever (i.e.in Paradise), with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: &lt;I&gt;Salâm &lt;/I&gt;(peace!) ." />  <aya id="24" text="See you not how Allâh sets forth a parable? - A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e. very high)." />  <aya id="25" text="Giving its fruit at all times, by the Leave of its Lord and Allâh sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember." />  <aya id="26" text="And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth having no stability." />  <aya id="27" text="Allâh will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allâh Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allâh will cause to go astray those who are &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn &lt;/I&gt;(polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.), and Allâh does what He wills." />  <aya id="28" text="Have you not seen those who have changed the Blessings of Allâh into disbelief (by denying Prophet Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; and his Message of Islâm), and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction?" />  <aya id="29" text="Hell, in which they will burn, - and what an evil place to settle in!" />  <aya id="30" text="And they set up rivals to Allâh, to mislead (men) from His Path! Say: &amp;quot;Enjoy (your brief life)!

Verily! Man is indeed an extreme wrong-doer, - a disbeliever (an extreme ingrate, denies Allâh's Blessings by disbelief, and by worshipping others besides Allâh, and by disobeying Allâh and His Prophet Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;)." />  <aya id="35" text="And (remember) when Ibrâhim (Abraham) said: &amp;quot;O my Lord!
