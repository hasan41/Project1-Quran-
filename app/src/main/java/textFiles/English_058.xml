<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><sura id="58">  <aya id="1" text="Indeed Allâh has heard the statement of her (Khaulah bint Tha'labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) concerning her husband (Aus bin As&amp;#173;Sâmit), and complains to Allâh. And Allâh hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Seer." />  <aya id="2" text="Those among you who make their wives unlawful (&lt;I&gt;Az-Zihâr ÇáÙåÇÑ&lt;/I&gt;) to them by saying to them &amp;quot;You are like my mother's back.&amp;quot; They cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie. And verily, Allâh is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving." />  <aya id="3" text="And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) (by &lt;I&gt;Az-Zihâr ÇáÙåÇÑ&lt;/I&gt;) and wish to free themselves from what they uttered, (the penalty) in that case (is) the freeing of a slave before they touch each other. That is an admonition to you (so that you may not return to such an ill thing). And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do." />  <aya id="4" text="And he who finds not (the money for freeing a slave) must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And for him who is unable to do so, he should feed sixty of &lt;I&gt;Miskîn&lt;/I&gt; (poor). That is in order that you may have perfect Faith in Allâh and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allâh. And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment." />  <aya id="5" text="Verily, those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) will be disgraced, as those before them (among the past nation), were disgraced. And We have sent down clear &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). And for the disbelievers is a disgracing torment." />  <aya id="6" text="On the Day when Allâh will resurrect them all together (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) and inform them of what they did. Allâh has kept account of it, while they have forgotten it. And Allâh is Witness over all things." />  <aya id="7" text="Have you not seen that Allâh knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no &lt;I&gt;Najwa&lt;/I&gt; (secret counsel) of three, but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven),  nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), not of less than that or more, but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be; and afterwards on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of everything." />  <aya id="8" text="Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden, and conspired together for sin and wrong doing and disobedience to the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; ). And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allâh greets you not, and say within themselves: &amp;quot;Why should Allâh punish us not for what we say?&amp;quot; Hell will be sufficient for them, they will burn therein, and worst indeed is that destination!" />  <aya id="9" text="O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrong-doing, and disobedience towards the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) but do it for &lt;I&gt;Al-Birr &lt;/I&gt;(righteousness) and &lt;I&gt;Taqwa &lt;/I&gt;(virtues and piety); and fear Allâh unto Whom you shall be gathered." />  <aya id="10" text="Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from &lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt; (Satan), in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allâh permits, and in Allâh let the believers put their trust ." />  <aya id="11" text="O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, (spread out and) make room. Allâh will give you (ample) room (from His Mercy). And when you are told to rise up [for prayers, &lt;I&gt;Jihâd &lt;/I&gt;(holy fighting in Allâh's Cause), or for any other good deed], rise up. Allâh will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allâh is Well-Acquainted with what you do." />  <aya id="12" text="O you who believe! When you (want to) consult the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be better and purer for you. But if you find not (the means for it), then verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." />  <aya id="13" text="Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation (with him)? If then you do it not, and Allâh has forgiven you, then (at least) perform &lt;I&gt;As-Salât &lt;/I&gt;(&lt;I&gt;Iqâmat&amp;#173;as&amp;#173;Salât&lt;/I&gt;) and give &lt;I&gt;Zakât&lt;/I&gt; and obey Allâh (i.e. do all what Allâh and His Prophet &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; order you to do). And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do." />  <aya id="14" text="Have you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) not seen those (hypocrites) who take for friends a people upon whom is the Wrath of Allâh (i.e. Jews)? They are neither of you (Muslims) nor of them (Jews), and they swear to a lie while they know." />  <aya id="15" text="Allâh has prepared for them a severe torment. Evil indeed is that which they used to do." />  <aya id="16" text="They have made their oaths a screen (for their evil actions). Thus they hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh, so they shall have a humiliating torment." />  <aya id="17" text="Their children and their wealth will avail them nothing against Allâh. They will be (the) dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever." />  <aya id="18" text="On the Day when Allâh will resurrect them all together (for their account), then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something (to stand upon). Verily, they are liars!" />  <aya id="19" text="&lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt; (Satan) has overtaken them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allâh. They are the party of &lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt; (Satan). Verily, it is the party of &lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt; (Satan) that will be the losers!" />  <aya id="20" text="Those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), they will be among the lowest (most humiliated)." />  <aya id="21" text="Allâh has decreed: &amp;quot;Verily!

For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with &lt;I&gt;Rûh&lt;/I&gt; (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And We will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allâh is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allâh. Verily, it is the Party of Allâh that will be the successful." /></sura>
