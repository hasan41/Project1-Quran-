And Glorified and Exalted be Allâh (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the &lt;I&gt;Mushrikûn &lt;/I&gt;(polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh; those who worship others along with Allâh or set up rivals or partners to Allâh).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="109" text="And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men, whom We inspired from among the people of townships. Have they not travelled through the earth and seen what was the end of those who were before them? And verily, the home of the Hereafter is the best for those who fear Allâh and obey Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds). Do you not then understand?" />  <aya id="110" text="(They were reprieved) until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied (by their people), then came to them Our Help, and whomsoever We willed were delivered. And Our Punishment cannot be warded off from the people who are &lt;I&gt;Mujrimûn &lt;/I&gt;(criminals, disobedients to Allâh, sinners, disbelievers, polytheists)." />  <aya id="111" text="Indeed in their stories, there is a lesson for men of understanding. It (the Qur'an) is not a forged statement but a confirmation of the Allâh's existing Books [the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel) and other Scriptures of Allâh] and a detailed explanation of everything and a guide and a Mercy for the people who believe." /></sura>
