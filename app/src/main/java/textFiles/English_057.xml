Let us get something from your light!&amp;quot; It will be said: &amp;quot;Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!&amp;quot; So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein.

And many of them were &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqûn &lt;/I&gt;(rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." />  <aya id="17" text="Know that Allâh gives life to the earth after its death!

But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and deny Our &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire." />  <aya id="20" text="Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children, as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers, evil-doers), and (there is) Forgiveness from Allâh and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers, good-doers), whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment." />  <aya id="21" text="Race one with another in hastening towards Forgiveness from your Lord (Allâh), and towards Paradise, the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers.

And Allâh likes not prideful boasters." />  <aya id="24" text="Those who are misers and enjoin upon people miserliness (Allâh is not in need of their charity). And whosoever turns away (from Faith  Allâh's Monotheism), then Allâh is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise." />  <aya id="25" text="Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice. And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war ), as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allâh may test who it is that will help Him (His religion), and His Messengers in the unseen. Verily, Allâh is All-Strong, All-Mighty." />  <aya id="26" text="And indeed, We sent Nûh (Noah) and Ibrahîm (Abraham), and placed in their offspring Prophethood and Scripture, and among them there is he who is guided, but many of them are &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqûn &lt;/I&gt;(rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." />  <aya id="27" text="Then, We sent after them, Our Messengers, and We sent 'Iesa (Jesus) &amp;#173; son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allâh therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance. So We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward, but many of them are &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqûn&lt;/I&gt; (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." />  <aya id="28" text="O you who believe [in Mûsa (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and 'Iesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians)]! Fear Allâh, and believe too in His Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), and He will forgive you. And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." />  <aya id="29" text="So that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may know that they have no power whatsoever over the Grace of Allâh, and that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills.
