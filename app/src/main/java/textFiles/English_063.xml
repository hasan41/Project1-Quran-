<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><sura id="63">  <aya id="1" text="When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), they say: &amp;quot;We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allâh.&amp;quot; Allâh knows that you are indeed His Messenger and Allâh bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed." />  <aya id="2" text="They have made their oaths a screen (for their hypocrisy). Thus they hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh. Verily, evil is what they used to do." />  <aya id="3" text="That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not." />  <aya id="4" text="And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allâh curse them! How are they denying (or deviating from) the Right Path." />  <aya id="5" text="And when it is said to them: &amp;quot;Come, so that the Messenger of Allâh may ask forgiveness from Allâh for you&amp;quot;, they turn aside their heads, and you would see them turning away their faces in pride." />  <aya id="6" text="It is equal to them whether you (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) ask forgiveness or ask not forgiveness for them. Verily, Allâh guides not the people who are the &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqîn&lt;/I&gt; (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh) ." />  <aya id="7" text="They are the ones who say: &amp;quot;Spend not on those who are with Allâh's Messenger, until they desert him.&amp;quot; And to Allâh belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites comprehend not." />  <aya id="8" text="They (hyprocrites) say: &amp;quot;If we return to Al-Madinah, indeed the more honourable ('Abdûllah bin Ubai bin Salul, the chief of hyprocrites at Al&amp;#173;Madinah) will expel therefrom the meaner (i.e. Allâh's Messenger &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;).&amp;quot; But honour, power and glory belong to Allâh, His Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not." />  <aya id="9" text="O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allâh. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers." />  <aya id="10" text="And spend (in charity) of that with which We have provided you, before death comes to one of you and he says: &amp;quot;My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while (i.e. return to the worldly life), then I should give &lt;I&gt;Sadaqah &lt;/I&gt;(i.e. &lt;I&gt;Zakât&lt;/I&gt;) of my wealth , and be among the righteous [i.e. perform &lt;I&gt;Hajj &lt;/I&gt;(pilgrimage to Makkah)]." />  <aya id="11" text="And Allâh grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes. And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do." /></sura>
