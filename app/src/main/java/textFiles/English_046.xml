But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned." />  <aya id="4" text="Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; to these pagans): &amp;quot;Think! All that you invoke besides Allâh show me! What have they created of the earth? Or have they a share in (the creation of) the heavens? Bring me a Book (revealed before this), or some trace of knowledge (in support of your claims), if you are truthful!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="5" text="And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allâh, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?" />  <aya id="6" text="And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping." />  <aya id="7" text="And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth (this Qur'ân), when it reaches them: &amp;quot;This is plain magic!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="8" text="Or say they: &amp;quot;He (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) has fabricated it.&amp;quot; Say: &amp;quot;If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allâh.

And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="9" text="Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;):&amp;quot;I am not a new thing among the Messengers (of Allâh) (i.e. I am not the first Messenger) nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="10" text="Say: &amp;quot;Tell me! If this (Qur'ân) is from Allâh, and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel ('Abdullâh bin Salâm ÑÖì &lt;&lt;code2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;codeb&gt;&gt;) testifies that this Qur'ân is from Allâh [like the Taurât (Torah)], so he believed (embraced Islâm) while you are too proud (to believe).&amp;quot; Verily! Allâh guides not the people who are &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doing)." />  <aya id="11" text="And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): &amp;quot;Had it (Islâmic Monotheism to which Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; is inviting mankind) been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!&amp;quot; And when they have not let themselves be guided by it (this Qur'ân), they say: &amp;quot;This is an ancient lie!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="12" text="And before this was the Scripture of Mûsa (Moses) as a guide and a mercy.

His mother bears him with hardship and she brings him forth with hardship, and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty (30) months, till when he attains full strength and reaches forty years, he says: &amp;quot;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my off-spring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly, I am one of the Muslims (submitting to Your Will).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="16" text="They are those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds.

Believe! Verily, the Promise of Allâh is true.&amp;quot; But he says: &amp;quot;This is nothing but the tales of the ancient.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="18" text="They are those against whom the Word (of torment) is justified among the previous generations of jinns and mankind that have passed away. Verily! They are ever the losers." />  <aya id="19" text="And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allâh) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged." />  <aya id="20" text="On the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh Islâmic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): &amp;quot;You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein. Now this Day you shall be recompensed with a torment of humiliation, because you were arrogant in the land without a right, and because you used to rebel and disobey (Allâh)." />  <aya id="21" text="And remember (Hûd) the brother of 'Ad, when he warned his people in &lt;I&gt;Al-Ahqâf &lt;/I&gt;(the curved sand-hills in the southern part of Arabian Peninsula). And surely, there have passed away warners before him and after him (saying): &amp;quot;Worship none but Allâh; truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="22" text="They said: &amp;quot;Have you come to turn us away from our &lt;I&gt;âliha &lt;/I&gt;(gods)? Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="23" text="He said: &amp;quot;The knowledge (of the time of its coming) is with Allâh only, and I convey to you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see that you are a people given to ignorance!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="24" text="Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: &amp;quot;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&amp;quot; Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened! a wind wherein is a painful torment!" />  <aya id="25" text="Destroying everything by the Command of its Lord! So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings! Thus do We recompense the people who are &lt;I&gt;Mujrimûn &lt;/I&gt;(polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, etc.)!" />  <aya id="26" text="And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts, but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(Allâh's Prophets and their Prophethood, proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!" />  <aya id="27" text="And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism)." />  <aya id="28" text="Then why did those whom they had taken for &lt;I&gt;âliha &lt;/I&gt;(gods) besides Allâh, as a way of approach (to Allâh) not help them? Nay, but they vanished completely from them (when there came the torment). And that was their lie, and their inventions which they had been inventing (before their destruction)." />  <aya id="29" text="And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) &lt;I&gt;Nafran &lt;/I&gt;(three to ten persons) of the jinns, (quietly) listening to the Qur'ân, when they stood in the presence thereof, they said: &amp;quot;Listen in silence!&amp;quot; And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners." />  <aya id="30" text="They said: &amp;quot;O our people! Verily! We have heard a Book (this Qur'ân) sent down after Mûsa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to a Straight Path (i.e. Islâm)." />  <aya id="31" text="O our people! Respond (with obedience) to Allâh's Caller (i.e. Allâh's Messenger Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and believe in him (i.e. believe in that which Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; has brought from Allâh and follow him). He (Allâh) will forgive you of your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire) ." />  <aya id="32" text="And whosoever does not respond to Allâh's Caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no &lt;I&gt;Auliyâ' &lt;/I&gt;(protectors) for him besides Allâh (from Allâh's Punishment). Those are in manifest error." />  <aya id="33" text="Do they not see that Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Yes, He surely is Able to do all things." />  <aya id="34" text="And on the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said to them): &amp;quot;Is this not the truth?&amp;quot; They will say: &amp;quot;Yes, By our Lord!&amp;quot; He will say: &amp;quot;Then taste the torment, because you used to disbelieve!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="35" text="Therefore be patient (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! This Qur'ân is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are &lt;I&gt;Al-Fâsiqûn &lt;/I&gt;(the rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." /></sura>
