Why do you hurt me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger of Allâh to you? So when they turned away (from the Path of Allâh), Allâh turned their hearts away (from the Right Path). And Allâh guides not the people who are &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqûn &lt;/I&gt;(rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." />  <aya id="6" text="And (remember) when 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: &amp;quot;O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allâh unto you confirming the Taurât [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmed .

Be you helpers (in the Cause) of Allâh as said 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), to &lt;I&gt;Al&amp;#173;Hawârîûn&lt;/I&gt; (the disciples): &amp;quot;Who are my helpers (in the Cause) of Allâh?&amp;quot; &lt;I&gt;Al&amp;#173;Hawârîeen&lt;/I&gt; (the disciples) said: &amp;quot;We are Allâh's helpers&amp;quot; (i.e. we will strive in His Cause!). Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the uppermost." /></sura>
