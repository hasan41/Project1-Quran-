<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><sura id="64">  <aya id="1" text="Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allâh. His is the dominion, and to Him belong all the praises and thanks, and He is Able to do all things." />  <aya id="2" text="He it is Who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers. And Allâh is All-Seer of what you do." />  <aya id="3" text="He has created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and made good your shapes, and to Him is the final Return." />  <aya id="4" text="He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And Allâh is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men)." />  <aya id="5" text="Has not the news reached you of those who disbelieved aforetime? And so they tasted the evil result of their disbelief, and theirs will be a painful torment." />  <aya id="6" text="That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs (signs), but they said: &amp;quot;Shall mere men guide us?&amp;quot; So they disbelieved and turned away (from the truth), and Allâh was not in need (of them). And Allâh is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise." />  <aya id="7" text="The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the Account). Say (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;): &amp;quot;Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of (and recompensed for) what you did, and that is easy for Allâh." />  <aya id="8" text="Therefore, believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), and in the Light (this Qur'ân) which We have sent down. And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do." />  <aya id="9" text="(And remember) the Day when He will gather you (all) on the Day of Gathering,  that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain (i.e. loss for the disbelievers as they will enter the Hell-fire and gain for the believers as they will enter Paradise). And whosoever believes in Allâh and performs righteous good deeds, He will remit from him his sins, and will admit him to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) to dwell therein forever, that will be the great success." />  <aya id="10" text="But those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and denied Our &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be the dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination ." />  <aya id="11" text="No calamity befalls, but with the Leave [i.e. decision and &lt;I&gt;Qadar &lt;/I&gt;(Divine Preordainments)] of Allâh, and whosoever believes in Allâh, He guides his heart [to the true Faith with certainty, i.e. what has befallen him was already written for him by Allâh from the &lt;I&gt;Qadar &lt;/I&gt;(Divine Preordainments)], and Allâh is the All-Knower of everything." />  <aya id="12" text="Obey Allâh, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;), but if you turn away, then the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey (the Message) clearly." />  <aya id="13" text="Allâh! &lt;I&gt;Lâ ilâha illa Huwa&lt;/I&gt; (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and in Allâh (Alone), therefore, let the believers put their trust." />  <aya id="14" text="O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you (i.e. may stop you from the obedience of Allâh), therefore beware of them! But if you pardon (them) and overlook, and forgive (their faults), then verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." />  <aya id="15" text="Your wealth and your children are only a trial, whereas Allâh! With Him is a great reward (Paradise)." />  <aya id="16" text="So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can; listen and obey; and spend in charity, that is better for yourselves. And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, then they are the successful ones." />  <aya id="17" text="If you lend to Allâh a goodly loan (i.e. spend in Allâh's Cause) He will double it for you, and will forgive you. And Allâh is Most Ready to appreciate and to reward, Most Forbearing," />  <aya id="18" text="All-Knower of the unseen and seen, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." /></sura>
