But if you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) bring to them any sign or proof, (as an evidence for the truth of your Prophethood), the disbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): &amp;quot;You follow nothing but falsehood, and magic.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="59" text="Thus does Allâh seal up the hearts of those who know not [the proofs and evidence of the Oneness of Allâh i.e. those who try not to understand true facts that which you (Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) have brought to them]." />  <aya id="60" text="So be patient (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;).
