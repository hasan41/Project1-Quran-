And thus do We reward the &lt;I&gt;Muhsinûn&lt;/I&gt; (i.e. good doers - see the footnote of V.9:120)." />  <aya id="15" text="And he entered the city at a time of unawareness of its people, and he found there two men fighting, - one of his party (his religion - from the Children of Israel), and the other of his foes. The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe, so Mûsa (Moses) struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: &amp;quot;This is of &lt;I&gt;Shaitân&lt;/I&gt;'s (Satan) doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="16" text="He said: &amp;quot;My Lord!

He said: &amp;quot;What is the matter with you?&amp;quot; They said: &amp;quot;We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take (their flocks). And our father is a very old man.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="24" text="So he watered (their flocks) for them, then he turned back to shade, and said: &amp;quot;My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="25" text="Then there came to him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: &amp;quot;Verily, my father calls you that he may reward you for having watered (our flocks) for us.&amp;quot; So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: &amp;quot;Fear you not. You have escaped from the people who are &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (polytheists, disbelievers, and wrong-doers).&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="26" text="And said one of them (the two women): &amp;quot;O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="27" text="He said: &amp;quot;I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years, but if you complete ten years, it will be (a favour) from you. But I intend not to place you under a difficulty. If Allâh will, you will find me one of the righteous.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="28" text="He [Mûsa (Moses)] said: &amp;quot;That (is settled) between me and you whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me, and Allâh is Surety over what we say.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="29" text="Then, when Mûsa (Moses) had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of Tûr (Mount). He said to his family: &amp;quot;Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring to you from there some information, or a burning fire-brand that you may warm yourselves.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="30" text="So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree: &amp;quot;O Mûsa (Moses)!

I am Allâh, the Lord of the &lt;I&gt;'Alamîn &lt;/I&gt;(mankind, jinns and all that exists)!" />  <aya id="31" text="&amp;quot;And throw your stick!&amp;quot; But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and looked not back.

Verily, you are of those who are secure." />  <aya id="32" text="&amp;quot;Put your hand in your bosom, it will come forth white without a disease, and draw your hand close to your side to be free from fear (that which you suffered from the snake, and also by that your hand will return to its original state). these are two &lt;I&gt;Burhân&lt;/I&gt; (signs, miracles, evidences, proofs) from your Lord to Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs. Verily, they are the people who are &lt;I&gt;Fâsiqûn&lt;/I&gt; (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh)." />  <aya id="33" text="He said: &amp;quot;My Lord! I have killed a man among them, and I fear that they will kill me." />  <aya id="34" text="&amp;quot;And my brother Hârûn (Aaron) he is more eloquent in speech than me so send him with me as a helper to confirm me.

I fear that they will belie me.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="35" text="Allâh said: &amp;quot;We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power, so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="36" text="Then when Mûsa (Moses) came to them with Our Clear &lt;I&gt;Ayât &lt;/I&gt;(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they said: &amp;quot;This is nothing but invented magic. Never did we hear of this among our fathers of old.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="37" text="Mûsa (Moses) said: &amp;quot;My Lord knows best him who came with guidance from Him, and whose will be the happy end in the Hereafter.

But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers)." />  <aya id="46" text="And you (O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;) were not at the side of the Tûr (Mount) when We did call, [it is said that Allâh called the followers of Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt; , and they answered His Call, or that Allâh called Mûsa (Moses)]. But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may remember or receive admonition.

Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Mûsa (Moses) of old? They say: &amp;quot;Two kinds of magic [the Taurât (Torah) and the Qur'ân] each helping the other!&amp;quot; And they say: &amp;quot;Verily! In both we are disbelievers.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="49" text="Say (to them, O Muhammad &lt;tt&gt;SAW&lt;/tt&gt;): &amp;quot;Then bring a Book from Allâh, which is a better guide than these two [the Taurât (Torah) and the Qur'ân], that I may follow it, if you are truthful.&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="50" text="But if they answer you not (i.e. do not believe in your doctrine of Islâmic Monotheism, nor follow you), then know that they only follow their own lusts.

Allâh guides not the people who are &lt;I&gt;Zâlimûn&lt;/I&gt; (wrong-doers, disobedient to Allâh, and polytheists)." />  <aya id="51" text="And indeed now We have conveyed the Word (this Qur'ân in which is the news of everything to them), in order that they may remember (or receive admonition)." />  <aya id="52" text="Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.] before it, - they believe in it (the Qur'ân)." />  <aya id="53" text="And when it is recited to them, they say: &amp;quot;We believe in it.

We have been the inheritors." />  <aya id="59" text="And never will your Lord destroy the towns (populations) until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Verses.

Will you not then see?&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="73" text="It is out of His Mercy that He has put for you night and day, that you may rest therein (i.e. during the night) and that you may seek of His Bounty (i.e. during the day), and in order that you may be grateful." />  <aya id="74" text="And (remember) the Day when He (your Lord Allâh) will call them (those who worshipped others along with Allâh), and will say: &amp;quot;Where are My (so-called) partners, whom you used to assert?&amp;quot;" />  <aya id="75" text="And We shall take out from every nation a witness, and We shall say: &amp;quot;Bring your proof.&amp;quot; Then they shall know that the truth is with Allâh (Alone), and the lies (false gods) which they invented will disappear from them." />  <aya id="76" text="Verily, Qârûn (Korah) was of Mûsa's (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. When his people said to him: &amp;quot;Do not be glad (with ungratefulness to Allâh's Favours). Verily! Allâh likes not those who are glad (with ungratefulness to Allâh's Favours)." />  <aya id="77" text="But seek, with that (wealth) which Allâh has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allâh has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land.
